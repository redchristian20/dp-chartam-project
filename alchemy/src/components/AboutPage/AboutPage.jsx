                        Alchemy was founded in 2008 by Marinez Burnett. Marinez is an RN, and her objective for Alchemy was to approach medical transcription with the same care and attention to detail as would be applied to an actual patient. Additional services such as virtual assistance and call center operations have been added in recent years.

                        Alchemy was founded on the principle that quality must be paramount to everything they do because their work directly impacts participants. The highest level of quality can only be achieved when the utmost attention to detail is applied in every step of the process, and the work is performed by people who have the training and experience to do things right. Because of this, all medical transcription work is performed by employees who have earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing and are Board Licensed registered nurses. Alchemy is the only company in the world to hold this standard this high for its transcription staff.
